Project Overview:
In this project, I've implemented a web application using the app.js code snippet provided. The application includes a unique slicing tool designed to clip images, enhancing user interaction and creativity. I've leveraged HTML canvases to showcase images in a condensed format. Upon selection, these images expand into a designated canvas, enabling users to perform image clipping operations. Clipped images are then displayed on a separate canvas.

A key feature of the application is the ability to delete clipped images at the user's discretion. This functionality offers flexibility and efficient content management.

Implementation Routes:
To achieve the aforementioned functionalities, the following route structure has been employed:

Page 1 (/page1): Displays initial content.
Page 2 (/page2): Integrates the slicing tool and canvas interactions.
Page 3 (/page3): Facilitates image deletion.
BookPage Component
The BookPage component plays a vital role in the project. It interfaces with a PostgreSQL database to retrieve sliced images, which primarily encompass top view, front view, and side view of an object. The user-friendly form within BookPage streamlines the input process for users.

PadForm and Area Calculations:
Within the Booking page, the PadForm component has been implemented. This form collects user input for length, breadth, and walk-around area. These inputs serve as the basis for calculating both the occupied area and the footprint area of a given product. This calculated information is pivotal for generating a rectangular tile. This tile can subsequently be stored within an assembly pad located in various plant areas provided within the application.

Additional Pages
Login Page: Enables user authentication.
Dashboard Page: Serves as the main hub, providing an overview of various functionalities.
Planning Page: Offers features for project planning and management.
This project encompasses a comprehensive and interactive web application, harmonizing canvas-based image manipulation, database integration, and area calculations to enhance user experience and productivity.
